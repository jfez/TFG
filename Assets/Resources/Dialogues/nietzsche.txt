<time/>000.100|To the despisers of the body will I speak my word.
<time/>004.000|I wish them neither to learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to their own bodies,—and thus be dumb.
<time/>012.250|"Body am I, and soul"—so saith the child.
<time/>016.500|And why should one not speak like children?
<time/>020.000|But the awakened one, the knowing one, saith:
<time/>022.250|"Body am I entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the body."
<time/>029.500|The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a peace, a flock and a shepherd.
<time/>038.800|An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother, which thou callest "spirit"—a little instrument and plaything of thy big sagacity.
<time/>049.000|"Ego," sayest thou, and art proud of that word.
<time/>052.500|But the greater thing—in which thou art unwilling to believe—is thy body with its big sagacity; it saith not "ego," but doeth it.
<time/>061.000|What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its end in itself.
<time/>067.500|But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are the end of all things: so vain are they.
<time/>074.000|Thus Spoke Zarathustra, <b>Friedrich Nietzsche</b>, 1883.
